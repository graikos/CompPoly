# CompPoly Development Roadmap

## Vision

CompPoly aims to be the premier formally verified library for computable polynomial operations over finite fields, serving as the mathematical foundation for zero-knowledge circuit verification. We aim to provide efficient, proven-correct implementations of univariate, multivariate, and multilinear polynomial arithmetic that seamlessly integrate with the Lean 4/Mathlib ecosystem.

## V1.0 Criteria

1. Zero `sorry`s in all shipped modules.
1. Complete core API for `CPolynomial`, `CMvPolynomial`, `CMlPolynomial`, including evaluation + interpolation + conversions.
1. ✅ At least one "fast path" implemented + proven correct (FFT/NTT multiplication OR fast multilinear transforms). *(radix-2 NTT / `NTTFast` univariate multiplication)*
1. Benchmarks exist for core ops and are reproducible (`lake exe CompPolyBench`; CI runs benchmarks and uploads reports).
<!-- 1. Property tests exist for core ops (eval, mul, interpolation). -->
1. Proof ergonomics baseline: common operations (add, mul, eval) mostly simp/grind-driven, documented.
1. At least one real integration example (ArkLib or RT extraction exemplar) demonstrating use as a dependency.
1. Minimal docs: README + module docs sufficient for contributors.
1. CI stability: all tests pass consistently.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Theoretical Foundation

**Goal**: Establish complete mathematical foundations and close critical gaps.

#### Priorities

1. **Theoretical completeness**
   - ✅ Implement `nodal` and `interpolate` for Lagrange interpolation
   - ✅ Implement `AddCommGroup`/`Semiring`/`CommSemiring`/`Ring`/`CommRing` instances for `CPolynomial` and `QuotientCPolynomial`
   - ✅ Prove isomorphism between `CPolynomial` and Mathlib's `Polynomial` (`ringEquiv` in `Univariate/ToPoly.lean`); prove for `QuotientCPolynomial` as needed
   - ✅ Prove `CommSemiring` for `CMvPolynomial` and `polyRingEquiv` (ring isomorphism with Mathlib's `MvPolynomial (Fin n) R`)
   - ✅ Complete remaining algebraic structures (`CommRing`, `Algebra`, scalar action / `SMulZeroClass`)

1. **API completeness**
   - ✅ Add `monomial` constructors for univariate and multivariate polynomials
   - ✅ Implement monomial-order baseline (`MonomialOrder.degree`, `leadingMonomial`, `leadingCoeff`, `leadingTerm`)
   - ✅ `degreeLT`, `degreeLE`: Bounded-degree submodules for univariate polynomials
   - ✅ `mem_degreeLT`, `mem_degreeLE`: Membership characterizations for bounded-degree polynomials
   - ✅ `degreeLTEquiv`: Linear equivalence for coefficient access
   - ✅ `restrictDegree`: Degree restrictions for multilinear extensions
   - ✅ `vars`: Variable set extraction
   - ✅ `aeval`, `bind₁`: Algebra evaluation and substitution
   - ✅ `algebra`, `module`: Algebra and module structures
   - ✅ `degrees`; ✅ `eval₂Hom`: Degree utilities and evaluation homomorphisms
   - ✅ `finSuccEquiv`: Variable manipulation equivalences (for `CMvPolynomial`)
   - ✅ `isEmptyRingEquiv` for `CMvPolynomial 0 R`
   - ✅ `smulZeroClass`: Scalar multiplication with zero behavior
   - ✅ `sumToIter`: Iteration utility with reconstruction/API lemmas
   - ✅ Implement `rename` / `renameEquiv` for variable renaming

1. **Further data types**
   - ✅ Basic field definitions (currently in Arklib) ported into CompPoly (e.g. BabyBear, Goldilocks, BN254, BLS12_381, binary tower)
      - ✅ computable field extensions with interface (`CompPoly/Fields/Extension/`):
        binomial extensions `F[X]/(X^d - W)` with `CommRing`/`Field`, `Algebra F (Ext P)`
        (hence `Module`), a base embedding `ofBase`, the adjoined root `gen` with
        `gen ^ d = ofBase W` and `aeval gen poly = 0`, a ring equivalence to `AdjoinRoot`,
        cardinality `q ^ d`, and a general Rabin irreducibility criterion
        (`CompPoly/Data/Polynomial/Rabin.lean`). Concrete degree-4 instances over
        BabyBear, KoalaBear, and Hachi (`2^32 - 99`).
         - Tower support (`AlgebraTower`) is the main interface gap: `F ⊂ Ext F 2 ⊂ Ext F 4`
           does not yet compose
         - 🔄 Performance: `mul` currently measures ~13.4us and `inv` ~1.7ms on
           KoalaBear degree 4 (`lake exe CompPolyBench`), which is far off a native
           implementation. In priority order: replace the nested `Finset.sum` in
           `Ext.mul` with an **O(d^2)** allocation-free array loop (behind an agreement lemma
           or `@[csimp]`; the current definition visits d^3 terms, so a rewrite must drop the
           asymptotic shape and not merely the allocations); instantiate over the `FastField`
           Montgomery carrier instead of `ZMod`; replace Fermat inversion with a norm-based
           inverse using the Frobenius map (a coordinate-wise scaling when `d | q - 1`)
         - Rebase the GHASH Rabin specialization
           (`irreducible_of_rabin_128_passed_over_GF2`) onto the general
           `Polynomial.irreducible_of_rabin` so the two soundness proofs do not need
           parallel maintenance
         - Tower support (`AlgebraTower`) so `F ⊂ Ext F 2 ⊂ Ext F 4` composes, enabling the
           Mersenne31 CM31/QM31 Circle-STARK stack
         - 64-bit-radix Montgomery layer, so `Hachi` gets a `FastField` base
   - ✅ Implement a specialized Bivariate polynomial type, e.g. as `CPolynomial (CPolynomial R)` with specialized polynomial operations (that can then be optimized)

**Success Criteria**: Zero `sorry`s in core operations, all ring structures complete, clean build with no warnings, reasonable proof ergonomics.

### Phase 2: Performance & Efficiency

**Goal**: Optimize critical operations for production use in ZK verification.

#### Priorities
1. **Fast field arithmetic**
   - Optimized implementations of off-the-shelf available Field instances to enable performance, including for prime and other finite fields

2. **Polynomial multiplication**
   - ✅ Radix-2 NTT domain, forward/inverse transforms, and reference fast multiply (`Univariate/NTT/`)
   - ✅ NTT-based `fastMulImpl` / `safeFastMul` / `withFallback` with full correctness proofs (`NTT/FastMul`)
   - ✅ Concrete NTT domains for BabyBear and KoalaBear (`NTT/BabyBear`, `NTT/KoalaBear`)
   - ✅ Low-product multiplication via NTT (`NTT/FastMulLow`)
   - ✅ Optimized `NTTFast` path: cached twiddle plans, DIF/radix-4 stages, paired forward transforms, refinement proofs vs `NTT` (`Univariate/NTTFast/`)
   - ✅ Pluggable multiply backends for batch algorithms (`BatchEval/Context`: `MulContext.ntt`, `MulContext.nttFast`)
   - 🔄 Additional concrete domains and field-specific tuning beyond BabyBear/KoalaBear

3. **Exponentiation optimization**
   - ✅ Replace repeated multiplication with repeated squaring
   - ✅ Reduce complexity from O(n) to O(log n) multiplications

4. **Evaluation optimizations**
   - ✅ Batch evaluation at multiple points: naive, Horner, and subproduct-tree algorithms (`Univariate/BatchEval/`)
   - ✅ Subproduct-tree batch eval with configurable multiply/remainder backends (naive, NTT, NTTFast)
   - ✅ Add Horner's method where beneficial
   - Optimize for common ZK evaluation patterns

5. **Complete multilinear transform functions**
   - ✅ Complete documentation of zeta/Möbius transform formulas
   - ✅ Prove equivalence between fast and spec implementations
   - 🔄 Add performance guarantees and complexity proofs (done in comments, formal benchmarking still TODO)

6. **Benchmarking**
   - ✅ Basic, reproducible evaluation benchmark executable (`lake exe CompPolyBench`; see `bench/README.md`)
   - ✅ CI build/run with artifact upload (GitHub Actions `lean_action_ci.yml`)
   - 🔄 Expand regression coverage and published performance baselines

7. **Bivariate polynomial operations**
   - Optimize the existing bivariate polynomial type `CPolynomial (CPolynomial R)` and evaluate whether a more specialized representation is beneficial
   - Efficient factorization algorithms for bivariate polynomials
   - ✅ Integration with existing `CMvPolynomial 2 R` with equivalence proofs

7. **Error-correcting interpolation algorithms**
   - Implement Berlekamp-Welch algorithm for Reed-Solomon decoding
   - Implement Guruswami-Sudan list-decoding algorithm
   - Proofs of correctness
   - Integration with FRI commitments and polynomial commitment schemes

**Success Criteria**: notable speedup for large polynomial operations, verified correctness, benchmarks demonstrating competitive performance with industry-standard implementations.

### Phase 3: Further Optimization and Integration

**Goal**: Turn CompPoly into an integration-ready, downstream-friendly library by adding interoperability layers, serialization, proof automation, and extraction compatibility.

#### Priorities

1. **Lowering / interop with LLZK / PrimeIR polynomial dialects**
	- Explore representing CompPoly structures in the MLIR pipeline
	- Evaluate tradeoffs: “fast Lean code” vs “Lean spec + lowering to fast backend”
	- Goal: enable verification of PrimeIR/LLZK polynomial implementations against CompPoly semantics
2.	**Serialization (bytes/JSON/protocol/hashing)**
	- Define serialization format(s) for polynomial types
	- Compatibility with ArkLib protocol serialization needs
	- Consider: to/from bytes, to/from JSON, canonical encoding for hashing
3.	**FFT-based interpolation variants (post-FFT/NTT)**
	- Implement FFT-based Lagrange interpolation when the evaluation domain is an FFT/NTT-friendly subgroup
	- Add fast barycentric interpolation for repeated interpolation queries over a fixed set of nodes
	- Provide `interpolateFFT` / `interpolateNTT` APIs that reuse precomputed twiddle factors and domain metadata
	- Prove equivalence to the spec (naive) `interpolate` implementation and document complexity (O(n log n))
	- Include edge-case handling: non-power-of-two domains, zero-padding strategies, and domain mismatch errors
4.	**Proof ergonomics: simp/grind sets + tactics**
	- Identify rewrite bottlenecks when porting Mathlib poly proofs → CompPoly
	- Build simp sets and grind sets for common operations
	- Goal: “one-liner conversions” (or near) between spec polynomials and computable polynomials

5.	**Integration with ArkLib / Hax + Rust libraries (e.g. plonky3)**
	- Make CompPoly the canonical polynomial backend for ArkLib specs where applicable
	- Add bridging lemmas and conversion utilities across representations (CompPoly ↔ Mathlib ↔ extracted Rust ↔ downstream libs)
	- Document and implement invariants required for robust interop (canonical ordering, normalization, domain metadata)
	- Ensure hax-extracted Rust polynomial structures can be mapped into CompPoly with minimal proof overhead
	- Validate the integration with at least one downstream example (e.g. ArkLib protocol component or plonky3 polynomial routine)

**Success criteria**: CompPoly is integration-ready—it supports canonical serialization, has strong simp/grind-based proof ergonomics, includes a validated interop pathway with LLZK/PrimeIR-style representations, and demonstrates at least one end-to-end Rust extraction → Lean translation → refinement proof against CompPoly.
