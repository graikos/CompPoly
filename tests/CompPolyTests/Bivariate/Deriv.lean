# Bivariate Multiplicity Tests

Regression coverage for `CompPoly.CBivariate.checkMultiplicity`, the executable
multiplicity check used by the Guruswami–Sudan interpolation step.

The checks pin down the behaviour over finite fields of small characteristic,
where the multiplicity must be read off the shifted polynomial `Q(X + a, Y + b)`
rather than from ordinary partial derivatives: the latter acquire factorial
factors that vanish mod `p` and therefore *overcount* multiplicity. The two
`false` cases below are precisely the configurations an ordinary-derivative
definition would mis-report, so they guard against such a regression.

These are `#guard` checks: they run under `lake test` (via the `CompPolyTests`
driver) and are not elaborated by `lake build`.

-- `X³` over `𝔽₃` has multiplicity exactly `3` at the origin, so multiplicity `≥ 5` is false.
