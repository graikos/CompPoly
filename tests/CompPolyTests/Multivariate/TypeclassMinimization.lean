  # Multivariate Typeclass-Minimization Tests

  Compile-time regressions for the weakened multivariate core assumptions.
  The coefficient type below intentionally has `Zero`, `One`, `Add`, `Neg`, and `Mul`,
  but no semiring or ring structure, so these examples fail if stronger assumptions
  creep back into the API.
