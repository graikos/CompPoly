# `LawfulBEq` from `DecidableEq`

A canonical `LawfulBEq` derived from `DecidableEq`, suitable for `letI` use at
call sites that need to satisfy `BEq`/`LawfulBEq` constraints (for example on
`CMvPolynomial` API surfaces) from a `DecidableEq`-only context.

This is intentionally *not* registered as an instance: doing so would conflict
with other `BEq` paths chosen by typeclass synthesis.
