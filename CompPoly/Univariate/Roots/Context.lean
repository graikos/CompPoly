# Finite-Field Root Contexts

Explicit contexts for executable univariate root finding over finite fields.
The algorithms use the cardinality carried here; downstream proofs use the
finite-field and splitter contracts without unfolding concrete implementations.

/-- A deterministic splitter for squarefree products of linear factors.

The executable function consumes the field cardinality and the current factor.
Completeness of the public root backend depends on splitter completeness for
every linear-factor product reached by the recursion.

  /--
  The precondition under which `complete` is claimed for the splitter input.

  Root backends should establish this predicate for the field-root product they
  pass to the splitter. Executable splitters may remain defensive outside this
  predicate, but completeness is only part of the contract under it.
