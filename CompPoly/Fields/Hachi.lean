# Hachi prime field `2^32 - 99`

A 32-bit prime field. The name is provisional.

`p - 1 = 2^2 · 3 · 13 · 67 · 163 · 2521`, so:

* `p ≡ 1 mod 4`, which is what makes `X^4 - W` irreducible for any non-square `W`
  (see `CompPoly/Fields/Hachi/Ext4.lean`);
* the two-adicity is only **2**, so unlike BabyBear and KoalaBear this field admits no large
  smooth multiplicative subgroup and therefore **no radix-2 NTT domain**. That is irrelevant for
  degree-4 extension arithmetic, which is schoolbook, but it does rule out the
  `CompPoly/Univariate/NTT*` fast-multiplication paths for polynomials over this field.

## Implementation notes

There is deliberately no `FastField` (Montgomery) implementation for this modulus.
`Montgomery/Native32Field.lean` requires `modulus < 2 ^ 31`, because radix-`2^32` Montgomery
reduction needs `x + m * p < 2 ^ 64`; at `p ≈ 2 ^ 32` that overflows `UInt64`. A 64-bit-radix
(or two-limb) Montgomery layer would be needed, and is orthogonal to the extension framework —
`CompPoly/Fields/Extension/` is generic over the base-field carrier and would pick it up
unchanged.
