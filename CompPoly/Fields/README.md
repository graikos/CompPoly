## Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Basic.lean** | `NonBinaryField` type class (char ≠ 2), polynomial composition lemmas (`coeffs_of_comp_minus_x`, `comp_x_square_coeff`). |

| **BLS12_377/Fast.lean** | Eight-limb Montgomery instantiation of the BLS12-377 scalar field: the `GcdData` and `Mont64x8Field` constants, `ScalarField`, `ofField`, and `ringEquiv`. |
| **BLS12_381.lean** | Facade for the BLS12-381 scalar-field modules, re-exporting the canonical field and the eight-limb Montgomery implementation. |

| **Extension.lean** | Facade for the binomial field-extension stack. |
| **Extension/Binomial.lean** | Irreducibility of `X^d - W` over a finite field: Rabin's test collapsed to two base-field exponentiations (`irreducible_X_pow_four_sub_C_iff`). |
| **Extension/Defs.lean** | `BinomialParams` (degree, `W`, base cardinality) and the carrier `Ext P = Vector F d` with its ring operations. |
| **Extension/Bridge.lean** | `toQuot : Ext P → AdjoinRoot P.poly`, its ring-hom and injectivity proofs, and `CommRing (Ext P)`. |
| **Extension/Field.lean** | Bijectivity (`ringEquivQuot`), cardinality, Fermat inversion, and `Field (Ext P)`. |
| **BabyBear/Ext4.lean** | \(\mathrm{BabyBear}[X]/(X^4 - 11)\). |
| **KoalaBear/Ext4.lean** | \(\mathrm{KoalaBear}[X]/(X^4 - 3)\). |
| **Hachi.lean** | \(2^{32} - 99\) — 32-bit prime field. **Name provisional.** Included as a 32-bit example rather than a production target: it exercises a base field with no Montgomery fast path (`Mont32Field` requires modulus < 2^31) and two-adicity 2, so no radix-2 NTT domain exists for it. |
| **Hachi/Ext4.lean** | \(\mathrm{Hachi}[X]/(X^4 - 2)\). |
| **Goldilocks.lean** | \(2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1\) — Plonky2/3. |
| **KoalaBear.lean** | Facade for KoalaBear modules, re-exporting the canonical field and fast native-word implementation. |
| **KoalaBear/Basic.lean** | \(2^{31} - 2^{24} + 1\) — lean Ethereum spec. |
| **KoalaBear/Fast.lean** | KoalaBear-namespaced API over the shared fast-field implementation (`Montgomery/Native32Field.lean`): thin wrappers forwarding the native `UInt32` Montgomery-residue operations and their `KoalaBear.Field` equivalence (`@[simp]`) lemmas. |
| **Mersenne.lean** | \(2^{31} - 1\) — Circle STARKs. |
| **Montgomery/Basic.lean** | Radix-generic Montgomery reduction, field-agnostic number theory shared by the fast prime fields. |
| **Montgomery/Native32.lean** | Raw `UInt32`/`UInt64` Montgomery reduction over explicit word constants, including bounds and correctness. |
| **Montgomery/Native32Field.lean** | Per-field parameters, the shared `FastField` carrier, arithmetic, instances, and canonical-field bridge. |
| **Montgomery/Native64x8Defs.lean** | Zero-import runtime definitions of the eight-limb (32-bit) Montgomery arithmetic, for `precompileModules` consumers (from CompPoly PR #274). |
| **Montgomery/Native64x8.lean** | Word-level specifications and add/sub/negate correctness for the eight-limb arithmetic. |
| **Montgomery/Native64x8Mul.lean** | Correctness of the eight-limb CIOS Montgomery multiplication. |
| **Montgomery/Native64x8Field.lean** | The `Mont64x8Field` class, the eight-limb `FastField` carrier, arithmetic, instances, and canonical-field bridge, for moduli below `2^255`. |
| **Montgomery/Native64x8InvDefs.lean** | Mathlib-free binary-GCD inversion runtime ([eprint 2020/972](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/972)): the `GcdData` schedule class, the divstep loop, the eight-limb candidate (`gcdInvCandidate`), and the checked raw inversion (`invGcdRaw`). |
| **Montgomery/Native64x8Inv.lean** | Correctness of the checked inversion: `invGcdRaw` computes the field inverse, `FastField.invGcd` is its proof-carrying wrapper; also the divstep coefficient bounds and the candidate's mac-width safety. |
| **Secp256k1.lean** | Base and scalar fields for the Secp256k1 curve (used in Bitcoin/Ethereum). |

## Binary-field modules

The `Binary/` subtree provides characteristic-2 field infrastructure used by GHASH and additive-NTT workflows:

- `Binary/BF128Ghash/*` — GF(2^128) model, implementation, and certificates.
- `Binary/AdditiveNTT/*` — additive-NTT domain/algorithm/correctness stack.
- `Binary/Tower/*` — abstract/concrete binary tower-field constructions and supporting lemmas.

## Field extensions

`Extension/` provides computable `F[X]/(X^d - W)` arithmetic in odd characteristic, with the
`Field` structure proved by transport along a ring equivalence to `AdjoinRoot (X^d - W)`, plus
`Algebra F (Ext P)`, a base embedding `ofBase`, and the adjoined root `gen` with
`gen ^ d = ofBase W`.
Irreducibility of the defining polynomial comes from Rabin's test, which for a binomial
collapses to two exponentiations in the base field — no generated certificates and no
`native_decide`. See [`../../docs/wiki/field-extensions.md`](../../docs/wiki/field-extensions.md).

The characteristic-2 `Binary/Tower/` stack is a separate, independent development.

## Primality proofs

Primality is proved via Pratt certificates (Lucas witnesses). Some field definitions (e.g. BN254, BLS12_377) use explicit `PrattCertificate'` proofs, while others construct certificate-driven primality proofs in a similar style.
