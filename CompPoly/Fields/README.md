# Fields for ZK Protocols

This directory contains formally verified field infrastructure used in zero-knowledge proof systems and elliptic-curve cryptography, including scalar prime fields and binary-field constructions.

## Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Basic.lean** | `NonBinaryField` type class (char ≠ 2), polynomial composition lemmas (`coeffs_of_comp_minus_x`, `comp_x_square_coeff`). |
| **PrattCertificate.lean** | Lucas test for primality and Pratt certificate infrastructure (`PrattCertificate`, `PrattCertificate'`) for proving concrete primality goals. |
| **BabyBear.lean** | Facade for BabyBear modules, re-exporting the canonical field and fast native-word implementation. |
| **BabyBear/Basic.lean** | \(2^{31} - 2^{27} + 1\) — Risc Zero. |
| **BabyBear/Fast.lean** | BabyBear-namespaced API over the shared fast-field implementation (`Montgomery/Native32Field.lean`): thin wrappers forwarding the native `UInt32` Montgomery-residue operations and their `BabyBear.Field` equivalence (`@[simp]`) lemmas. |
| **BLS12_377.lean** | Scalar field of BLS12-377 (253-bit, 2-adicity 47) — Zexe. |
| **BLS12_381.lean** | Scalar field of BLS12-381 (253-bit, 2-adicity 47). |
| **BN254.lean** | Scalar field of BN254 curve. |
| **Goldilocks.lean** | \(2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1\) — Plonky2/3. |
| **KoalaBear.lean** | Facade for KoalaBear modules, re-exporting the canonical field and fast native-word implementation. |
| **KoalaBear/Basic.lean** | \(2^{31} - 2^{24} + 1\) — lean Ethereum spec. |
| **KoalaBear/Fast.lean** | KoalaBear-namespaced API over the shared fast-field implementation (`Montgomery/Native32Field.lean`): thin wrappers forwarding the native `UInt32` Montgomery-residue operations and their `KoalaBear.Field` equivalence (`@[simp]`) lemmas. |
| **Mersenne.lean** | \(2^{31} - 1\) — Circle STARKs. |
| **Montgomery/Basic.lean** | Radix-generic Montgomery reduction, field-agnostic number theory shared by the fast prime fields. |
| **Montgomery/Native32.lean** | Raw `UInt32`/`UInt64` Montgomery reduction over explicit word constants, including bounds and correctness. |
| **Montgomery/Native32Field.lean** | Per-field parameters, the shared `FastField` carrier, arithmetic, instances, and canonical-field bridge. |
| **Montgomery/Native256.lean** | The `Mont256Field` data class and the CIOS reduction step over four `UInt64` limbs (`R = 2^256`); proof-free runtime defs serving the binary-GCD inverse candidate. |
| **Montgomery/Native256Gcd.lean** | Pornin binary GCD over limbs ([eprint 2020/972](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/972)): the proof-free fast inverse candidate, verified at its use site in `FastField.invGcd`. |
| **Montgomery/Native64x8Defs.lean** | Zero-import runtime definitions of the eight-limb (32-bit) Montgomery arithmetic, for `precompileModules` consumers (from CompPoly PR #274). |
| **Montgomery/Native64x8.lean** | Word-level specifications and add/sub/negate correctness for the eight-limb arithmetic. |
| **Montgomery/Native64x8Mul.lean** | Correctness of the eight-limb CIOS Montgomery multiplication. |
| **Montgomery/Native64x8Field.lean** | The `Mont64x8Field` class, the eight-limb `FastField` carrier, arithmetic, instances, and canonical-field bridge, for moduli below `2^255`. |
| **Montgomery/Native64x8Inv.lean** | Runtime-verified binary-GCD inversion for the eight-limb carrier, reusing the 64-bit-word candidate of `Native256Gcd` through limb conversion. |
| **Secp256k1.lean** | Base and scalar fields for the Secp256k1 curve (used in Bitcoin/Ethereum). |

## Binary-field modules

The `Binary/` subtree provides characteristic-2 field infrastructure used by GHASH and additive-NTT workflows:

- `Binary/BF128Ghash/*` — GF(2^128) model, implementation, and certificates.
- `Binary/AdditiveNTT/*` — additive-NTT domain/algorithm/correctness stack.
- `Binary/Tower/*` — abstract/concrete binary tower-field constructions and supporting lemmas.

## Primality proofs

Primality is proved via Pratt certificates (Lucas witnesses). Some field definitions (e.g. BN254, BLS12_377) use explicit `PrattCertificate'` proofs, while others construct certificate-driven primality proofs in a similar style.
